suitedAce() will: 
	- evaluate whether we have a suited ace (double suited ace will be in handsToplayfromanyposition())
	- we won't consider anything worse than this in terms of suited cards, so all else will return False

Wrap() will: 
	- Determine if there is any wrap potential in our hand.
	- There are a total of 3 ways to achieve this; no gapper, one-gapper high, one-gapper low]
	- I will only play wraps with the smallest card being 5 or greater

HighPairs() will: 
	- Determine whether we hold One or two high pair(s)
	- High pair is one where it is >= 10 


handsToPlayFromAnyPosition() will: 
 	- Define certain hands where we will play from any position, and outline what the action will be 


General note: I won't define what hands I won't play, it is easier just to define what I WILL play and the rest I will fold. 





Logic of bot: 
1. Calcuate the value of the hand (based on the aforementioned 3 functions)
2. Compare this value to the position that I am in relative to button and act accordingly. 
We will split this into 2 scenarios; 
	- button +2 anticlockwise (3 positions) BEST POSITIONS
	- button clockwise (3 positions) WORSE POSITIONS




Position plays: 
	- if the function handsToplayfromAnyposition is true, then play the hand as stated.
	Otherwise;

	On the button: 
		- play if any combination of two functions return True

	Position anticlockwise one seat next to the button: 
		- Same as on the button 

	Position anticlockwise two seat next to the button: 
		- Two pair + one other function true 
		- suited ace + one other function true

	Other positions; 
		- suited ace + wrap potential true 
		- suited ace + high pair
