Plan to do all 5 tasks:
- Tesseract can capture the name fo the oppoent, their stack, and also the amount they bet. 
- Need something that will detect numbers and letters for the nums_list. 
- Need to amend code and do screenshot to use openCV to read the suit for suit_list. 


This is just for general stuff, the detailed plan I will write in each of the tasks' folders.
